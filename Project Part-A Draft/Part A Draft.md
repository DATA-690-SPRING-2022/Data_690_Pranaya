### Intoduction:
Unemployment is When a person is ready to work but unable to secure a job. Mainly unemployment is caused by the three factors 
- Structural - Structural Unemployment Happen when the required skillset is not matched for the job demanded or when a worker is having a job but not able to attend the work place due to technical issues.
- Frictional - Frictinoal unemployment is happen when a person is looking for a job change or in between the jobs.
- Cyclical - Cyclical Unemployment Happens when the Economy faces recession in other words when economy crashes. during this time Unemployment rate will increases.  

In this project we are looking at Okun's Law regarding Unemployment rate. Okun's Law state that their is a relationship between a countryâ€™s unemployment and economic growth rates.
According to Okun's law, a country's gross domestic product (GDP) must expand at a pace of around 4% for one year in order to achieve a 1% reduction in unemployment.But their are 
some time where Okun's Law proved wrong especially during Americas 2008 recession. this project aim is to analysis the data from world bank using world development explorer tool to 
find how accurate is okun's law.

## Conclusion:
- From the Scatter plot We now Understand that As the GDP progress the Unemployment is reducing in the Country 
- but althought GDP and Unemployment Rate correlates but few time it Varies like during recision in 2008 at that time as the GDP progress the unemployement is also Incresed in united states and united kingdom
- so that many scientist and analysts and economists  argue that it is a inverse relationship between the GDP and Unemployment rate
- in my opinion the unemployment is related to GDP but as well as other factors also that causes the unemployment rate to increses or decreses.
